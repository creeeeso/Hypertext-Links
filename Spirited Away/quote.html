    <h4 style="color: white;text-align: center">One Summer's Day</h4>
    <p class="demopara">
        <div>"What's this old building? It looks like an entrance."</div>
        <div>"Honey, get back in the car we're going to be late. Chihiro!"</div>
        <div>"Oh for God's sake... This Building's not old, it's fake. This stone is made of plaster. The wind's pulling us in. " </div>
        <div>"What is it?"        </div>
<div>"Come on, Let's go in, I want to see what's on the other side."</div>
<div>"I'm not going! It's gives me the creeps!"</div>    
<div>"Don't be such a scaredy cat, Chihiro. Let's just take a look."</div>
<div>—Chihiro's parents venture into the tunnel</div>
</p>
<h4 style="color: white;text-align: center">Nightfall</h4>
<p class="demopara">
<div>"It's just a dream. Wake up, wake up. Wake up! Please wake up.</div>
<div>It's just a dream, a stupid dream. Go away, disappear. Disappear.</div>
<div>I'm fading away! This has to be a dream."</div>
<div>"Don't be afraid. I'm a friend."</div>
<div>"No, no, no!"</div>
<div>—Chihiro's starts to disappear</div>
</p>
<h4 style="color: white; text-align: center;">The Contract</h4>
<p>
<div>"Why on earth should I hire you? Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby. What job would I possibly have for someone like you? You're wasting your time. I've got all the bums I need. Or maybe I'll give you the nastiest job I've got... and work you night and day... until you breathe your very last breath!"</div>
<div>—Yubaba considers hiring Chihiro</div>
</p>
<h4 style="color: white;text-align: center">Life at the Bathhouse</h4>
<p>
<div>"It's a Stink Spirit - Yes, and a large one, too."</div>
<div>"It's headed straight for the bridge! Please turn back. Please go!"</div>
<div>"The baths are closed for the night. Please withdraw, please!"</div>
<div>"Stinky!"</div>
<div>"That's odd. Stink Spirits feel different."</div>
<div>"Well, now that it's here, better go greet it! All we can do is get rid of it fast."</div>
<div>—The Bathhouse staff encounter the Stink Spirit</div>
</p>
<h4 style="color: white;text-align: center">Sen's Courage</h4>
<p>
<div>"Who are you?"</div>
<div>"Yubaba's older twin sister. Now hand over the dragon."</div>
<div>"What are you going to do? He needs help."</div>
<div>"That dragon's a thief. He works for my sister. He stole a valuable seal from my house."</div>
<div>"Haku would never do that. He's too kind. All dragons are kind."</div>
<div>"Kind and stupid... and eager to learn my sister's magical ways. This boy will do anything that greedy woman wants. Now step aside."</div>
<div>—Chihiro meets Zeniba</div>
</p>
<p>
<h4 style="color: white;text-align: center">The Return</h4>
<div>"Go back the way you came. But don't look back until you're out of the tunnel."</div>
<div>"But what about you?"</div>
<div>"I'll tell Yubaba I'm quitting my apprenticeship. I'm fine now. I have my name back. Now I can go home too."</div>
<div>"Will we meet again somewhere?"</div>
<div>"I'm sure of it."</div>
<div>"Promise?"</div>
<div>"Promise."</div>
<div>"Now go, and don't look back."</div>
<div>—Haku says farewell to Chihiro</div>
